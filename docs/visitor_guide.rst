Visiting LINCC Frameworks at CMU
========================================================================================

Getting Around
---------------------------------------------------------------

**Getting to Town**

PIT - Pittsburgh international airport. About 20-30 minute cab ride from campus. CMU campus is located in Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood.

**Getting to the Offices**

CMU campus is old and hilly and dense. Often, the best way from A to B involves secret passageways. 
If you tell your host where you're staying, we can meet you somewhere in the middle and escort you through campus.

There are lots of options for getting around town, though.

**Biking**

* Bikeshare Program: POGOH (`pogoh.com <https://pogoh.com/>`__)

**Parking**

A car will not be needed for most visitors. If you are driving then we recommend parking in the `East Campus Garage <https://www.cmu.edu/parking/park/visitor.html>`__.
	
Lodging
---------------------------------------------------------------

* `CMU Hotel Listing <https://www.cmu.edu/parents/events/travel-and-hotels.html>`__
* Many hotels provide shuttle services to campus. Many hotels offer discounted rates to 
  Carnegie Mellon visitors. Make sure to ask about any CMU special rates when making reservations.
* If you want to check distances on the map, the building we'll be in on campus is Wean Hall. 
  Oakland area hotels will be the closest to campus.
* **Courtyard Pittsburgh University Center** - easy walk to campus, and close to easy dining options
* **Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh-University Place** - another easy walk.
* **Hotel Indigo Pittsburgh University-Oakland** - nice hotel with typically low rates. 
  It looks walkable, but there's a significant elevation change!!

Wean Hall
---------------------------------------------------------------

5th floor of Wean Hall is where the `main entrance is located <https://maps.app.goo.gl/sxbTox2xTejjGckP9>`__. 
There is also `an entrance <https://maps.app.goo.gl/WaJzBwVBpWLo9NYZ6>`__ on the 1st floor and 
connections to other buildings on different floors.


WEH 8100: LINCC Frameworks Corridor
---------------------------------------------------------------

LINCC Frameworks offices are located in the 8100 corridor of Wean Hall - 8th floor, go right from the elevators.

For conference space, there are typically three options:

* **WEH 8330** - large multi-function space. Room for 10-30.
* **WEH 8327** - large conventional conference room. Room for 10-25.
* **WEH 8104** - Melissa's office with mini conference setup. Room for 2-8.

Below is a rough wayfinding map of conference spaces, LINCC Frameworks offices, and available visitor desks:

COFFEE
---------------------------------------------------------------

Perhaps the most important topic: where to get specialty coffee on-campus.

**Nespresso**

Nespresso machine with a variety of flavors available in the "LINCC Lounge", WEH, 8101.

**La Prima Espresso**

Two locations, neither require going outside:

* Wean Hall, 5th floor lobby. You might be coming into the building at this entrance.
* Gates Building, 3rd floor lobby.

**Redhawk Coffee Roasters**

Scaife Hall, 1st floor lobby.

Some say it's better than La Prima, but you need ~1 minute outdoors.

CMU Campus Considerations
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Vaccine / mask policy on CMU campus
    * Employees are required to have vaccinations ("When eligible, all students, faculty and staff are required to receive a Covid-19 booster shot.")
    * Masks are encouraged, but not required. You definitely see people wearing masks, but it's probably ~10-15%
* 5th floor restrooms in Wean Hall are all-gender.  Other floors are gender-segregated due to 
  Pittsburgh zoning regulations, but with signage explicitly stating individuals should use the 
  restroom with which they are most comfortable.
* Building access - buildings are not locked during normal business hours. All floors and buildings are ADA compliant.
